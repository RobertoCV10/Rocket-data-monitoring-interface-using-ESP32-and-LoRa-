# This project centers on designing and developing an experimental didactic rocket for teaching aerospace technology. The rocket
is designed to carry a nominal payload of up to 300 grams to a maximum altitude of 100 meters, incorporating a custom-built flight computer
capable of measuring atmospheric variables (temperature, altitude, and pressure) and dynamic variables (orientation in pitch, roll,
and yaw axes). The system includes a real-time data transmission module to a ground base using LoRa communication with the
UART protocol, along with a parachute deployment mechanism that ensures the safe recovery of the fuselage. A significant aspect
of this project is the development of a custom electronics board integrating all sensors and communication modules, ensuring
efficient data acquisition and processing. Flight computer programming involves real-time data logging, sensor fusion algorithms,
and communication protocols for enhanced system reliability. The project addresses key challenges such as sensor integration,
propulsion system design, and real-time data processing. By leveraging refurbished model rocket components and advanced sensor
technologies, this project aims to provide a practical and educational platform for aerospace experimentation, contributing to the
development of low-cost, high-performance rocketry systems
